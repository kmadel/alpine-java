CloudBees Jenkins Analytics
Analytics is an important feature of the CloudBees Jenkins Platform.  Elasticsearch is used to index build and performance data of CloudBees Jenkins Enterprise masters that are connected to CloudBees Jenkins Operations Center (and optionally index data from CloudBees Jenkins Operations Center as well), and display that information via a set of built-in Kibana dashboards. However, your are not limited to the provided dashboards and may modify them or create completely new dashboards.  Kibana is exposed via the CloudBees Jenkins Operations Center Analytics Dashboard Creator link, allowing you to customize existing dashboards or create new ones. In this post, I will walk you through the process of creating a custom Kibana dashboard for a very specific use case - a Jenkins Audit Trail dashboard.
